I am an amateur in both of these skills. That&apos;s why I decided that I will devote the whole of 2023 to mastering these skills.</p><p>In the first 6 months from January to June 2023, I&apos;ll learn coding. And the latter half of the year I&apos;ll master the art of digital writing.</p><p>So, here it is!</p><h2 id="100-days-of-code-challenge-day-1">100 Days of Code Challenge: Day 1</h2><p>Today I am committing to the #100DaysofCode challenge.</p><p>I&apos;ll code for at least 1 hour every day for the next 100 days.

Usually, the weather is very wet and humid here in Kolkata. </p><p>Moreover, every July when I file my annual tax returns, I inadvertently get a huge shock.</p><p><em>When did I earn so much? Where has all the money gone?</em></p><p>Every year I feel the pain of losing money when I realize that I should have saved and invested much more than I had actually done.</p><p>It becomes even more painful if I have to pay more money to clear my tax dues. </p><p>Every year this makes me resolve that - </p><p><em>&quot;Before next year, I&apos;ll study and understand the income tax rules and apply them to plan and save as much tax as possible legally.&quot;</em></p><p>Yet, slowly the pain subsides and I completely forget about my decision until the next July comes.</p><p>This has been happening to me for the last 3-4 years. Finally, &#xA0;in December 2022, I decided that I&apos;ll give this long-time wish of mine a serious shot from January of 2023.</p><p>So, here it is....<strong>the lazy person&apos;s guide to the Indian income tax</strong>.</p><p>I am studying the Indian Income Tax rules as and noting my learning here for you all. Treat this as an open notebook and use it in whatever way you like.</p><p>Before you start, however, here&apos;s the disclaimer -</p><p>I am no tax expert or CA. And I have no intention to generate any cash flow by providing tax planning or consultancy in the future. So, everything that I have written here or in the other articles linked here is on the basis of my own understanding. All of this is for knowledge only. Please take advice from a qualified and authorized tax professional before taking any decision related to your own tax and money.</p><p>Okay, now that it&apos;s out of the way, let&apos;s start with the most obvious question -</p><h2 id="why-the-hell-do-you-have-to-pay-income-tax">Why The Hell Do You Have To Pay Income Tax?</h2><p>Who works his a** off every month from the 1st till the last day? </p><p>You.</p><p>Who skips those family dinners to crank up a few extra hours at the job for that incentive every year?</p><p>Again, it&apos;s you!</p><p>Do the taxmen ever come to help you when you run to catch the bus home? Or struggle to meet your deadlines?</p><p>Nope.</p><p>Then why on earth do you have to pay them? Year after year, every year? Is it really fair?</p><p>This is the question that burned in my head when I sat down to pay my taxes every year. I felt that I was getting robbed yet I could not do anything about it.</p><p>This changed after I started somewhat after I started learning about the tax system actively a few weeks back.</p><p>What does the Government do with the taxpayer&apos;s money?</p><ul><li>Build new and better roads, bridges, railways, and ports.</li><li>Strengthen our defence infrastructure.</li><li>Maintain law and order, and provide healthcare and education services.</li><li>Launch welfare schemes like - free food grains during the COVID-19 pandemic, free vaccines for the elderly, etc.</li></ul><p>Well, whether it&apos;s fair or unfair to collect taxes from the citizens could be a topic for debate for economists and tax experts. Let us set that debate aside and think practically.</p><p>It does seem that we can travel, sleep, work and live peacefully in India because the central and state governments do some of the above things with the money that they get in the form of our taxes.</p><p>Yes, I agree that everything is not perfect. </p><p>There have been huge scams, there are crooks who steal taxpayers&apos; money and flee the country. But the good work must not stop just because some people want to exploit it for their twisted interests.</p><p>You need to pay your taxes so that such good works may continue in India. </p><p>No matter which Government comes to power. All of them will launch such schemes through which at least a part of our huge number of poor and needy people will get some benefits.</p><p>You can take a small part in that good work by paying your taxes regularly.</p><h2 id="okay-then-should-you-do-nothing-and-pay-everything-that-the-taxmen-demand">Okay Then, Should You Do Nothing And Pay Everything That The Taxmen Demand?</h2><p>Not at all. </p><p>You are no monk! Neither am I.</p><p>We both know that there&apos;s actually no point fretting over the fairness of income tax. It is totally out of our control.</p><p>Instead, you can focus on what <em>is in your control -</em></p><h2 id="understand-how-income-tax-works-and-how-to-save-as-much-tax-as-possible-by-following-the-rules">Understand How Income Tax Works and How To Save As Much Tax As Possible By Following The Rules</h2><p>I am going to learn and understand as much as possible about the Income Tax Act, of 1961.</p><p>I&apos;ll write whatever I learn in the form of a series of articles. If it&apos;s necessary, I may build an online tool also. It will be free of course. But I have not yet decided about it.</p><p>Anyway, you might want to bookmark this article if you want to read my upcoming posts as well.</p><h3 id="so-here-is-the-list-of-articles">So, here is the list of articles -</h3><ol><li>Basic concepts about the taxation system in India.</li></ol>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How To Install A Local Ghost Blog On Ubuntu Desktop]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I like a minimal online editor for writing online.
